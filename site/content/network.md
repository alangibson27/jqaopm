### How to do it

Network play works by player A starting a session and player B joining:

1. At least one player must to ensure that *port forwarding* is enabled on their router for UDP traffic, on ports 7000
   and 7001. If both players can forward these ports, the chance of a successful connection is improved.

2. Agree on who should start the session. Generally, the player with the better network upload speeds should do this.

3. Choose a name for the session and share this by email, instant message, text message, smoke signal, or however else
   you choose. The name is only used to help you join up with the other player, and is forgotten as soon as both players
   have joined the session.

4. Player A chooses the *Start Session* option from the *Network* menu, and enters the code name in the pop-up. If
   they have port forwarding enabled, they should ensure the *I have enabled port forwarding* box is checked.
   
5. Player B chooses the *Join Session* option from the *Network* menu, confirms that they are happy for their Spectrum
   to be reset, and enters the code name in the pop-up. If they have port forwarding enabled, they should ensure the
   *I have enabled port forwarding* box is checked. 

6. After a short while, the pop-ups should disappear both players should see Player A's Spectrum. Player B will now
   have access to a restricted set of options from the menu.

7. Player B can use the keys Q, A, O, P and M as a joystick controller. If Player A and B both select the same joystick,
   Player B has priority and Player A's joystick will be deactivated.
   
   While Player B is joining Player A's session, a reduced set of menu items will be available, and sound will not be
   activated.

Status messages below the display will show the current connection status. The colour of the message indicates the
overall quality of the connection:

* Green: The connection is good enough for games to be playable.
* Yellow: The connection quality is poor, and delays may be experienced.
* Red: The connection has dropped, either temporarily or permanently.

### Reconnecting

If you restart Plus-F and want to resume your previous session, select the *Reconnect* item from the *Network* menu.
You will be reconnected to your partner, provided the partner is still running Plus-F.
