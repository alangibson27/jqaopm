The +F Guest is a program that receives screen updates from a +F Emulator across a network, and sends back
keypresses translated to Kempston joystick movements. This means that a user of the guest can participate in a
two-player game, provided the game has Kempston joystick support (most have).

## Keyboard Controls

At present, controls are not redefinable and are fixed to the conventional ones below:

The Guest can also be controlled by the options in the menu bar at the top of the screen.
