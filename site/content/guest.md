The Plus-F Guest is a program that receives screen updates from a Plus-F Emulator across a network, and sends back
keypresses translated to Kempston joystick movements. This means that a user of the guest can participate in a
two-player game, provided the game has Kempston joystick support (most have).

## Keyboard Controls
