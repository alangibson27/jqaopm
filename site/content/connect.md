### How to do it

Network play works by player A running the Emulator and player B running the Guest:

1. At least one player must to ensure that *port forwarding* is enabled on their router for UDP traffic, on ports 7000
   and 7001. If both players can forward these ports, the chance of a successful connection is improved.

2. Agree on who should run the Emulator. Generally, the player with the better network upload speeds should do this.

3. Choose a code name and share this by email, instant message, text message, smoke signal, or however you choose.
   It's not especially important what this code is, and you can use the same one over and over again if you like.
   They are only retained until the connection has been made, at which point the +F Relay Service forgets it again.

4. Players A and B both choose the *Connect* option from the *Network* menu, and enter the code name in the pop-up.

5. After a short while, the pop-up should disappear and the Emulator's screen should be shared with the Guest.

5. The guest can use the keys Q, A, O, P and M as a Kempston joystick controller.

Status messages below the display will show the current connection status. The colour of the message indicates the
overall quality of the connection:

* Green: The connection is good enough for games to be playable.
* Yellow: The connection quality is poor, and delays may be experienced.
* Red: The connection has dropped, either temporarily or permanently.
