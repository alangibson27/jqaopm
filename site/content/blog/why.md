Why did I bother writing +F? There are already plenty of fully-featured, freely-available Spectrum emulators for
more or less any platform you care to think of. Indeed, I remember using a perfectly playable one on the Commodore
Amiga as far back as 1994 or 1995 (ZXAM by Antonio J. Pomar Rosell√≥), so it's hardly a novel idea.

I did have a little twist which I wanted to add, which at the time I started writing didn't appear to be available
in any other emulator, namely the ability to play games across the Internet. (It turns out that [RealSpec](http://zxm.speccy.cz/realspec/)
claims to do this and more, but I haven't tried it.)

More than just that, though, it was probably inevitable I would end up trying this sooner or later. Much like
mountaineers are reputed to climb mountains "because they're there", or lovelorn teenage boys write dreadful and
embarrassing poetry, the chances of a programming geek with a fondness for 80s gaming writing an emulator are
rather high. (Given I'd already written a
[Chrome plugin that uses CSS to emulate of Spectrum loading borders](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speccy-loading-borders/jakeajfeddddpglibndhjhdmlinejihf),
it's safe to say that I've got form.)

*So Mr. Nerdy-Nerdy has a warm, fuzzy feeling about his pet project*, you may be thinking. *Very good, move along.*

And to a certain extent, you're right. There's nothing novel about +F and I certainly wasn't planning to blog about
it. Indeed, if I was just a programming geek by night, I probably wouldn't have, but I've actually also been a programming
geek by profession for the best part of two decades. When you do anything for that length of time, it becomes something
of an overlearned skill, something you don't necessarily have to devote much conscious thought to.
You learn all manner of techniques and best practices from the people you work with, you learn your own lessons, and
most of all you tend to adopt and fit in with the way that your team works.

Combine that with time pressures and shifting requirements, and it can be easy to forget *why* you do things the way
you do them. Best practices with some longevity are likely to provide benefits, but it's easy to develop something of a
ritualistic mentality about the way you build software. *If we write the magic number of unit tests, make sure the size
in bytes of our zip file is an odd number and sacrifice a chicken, we'll have a successful release.*

With +F being a personal hobby project, and me being answerable to nobody but myself for its success or otherwise, I
wasn't subject to the formalities of software development which I've become used to in my day job. I could completely
freely choose which ones to follow and which ones to ignore. What it made me realise, time and again, was that the
practices which my colleagues and I seem to settling upon feel to me something like a fundamental set of
laws of software, which apply everywhere and anywhere in the Universe. (Well, my corner of the Universe, anyway.)

And that's what prompted me to start blogging. While I do intend to take the odd diversion into
the simultaneously mundane and fascinating details of emulation, I'll mainly be treating you to a series of stories on
the gaffes, goofs and prat-falls that led me to realise why doing or not doing a particular thing was a good or bad idea.

I hope you find it enjoyable.
