Over the two decades that I've been in software, there have been all number of innovations, techniques, tools,
tricks and plain fads which purport to help you build applications better - model-driven code generation, unit testing,
documenting everything, documenting nothing, pair programming, SOAP, REST, microservice architectures to name a few.
I can understand why most of them (with the exception of SOAP, which is an abomination) could be thought to deliver
some sort of benefit, but for me there's one which stands above all the others: Test-Driven Development.
