Spectrum games are available for use in emulators in a number of file formats, the most popular ones being
Z80, TAP and TZX. At present, Plus-F can only load and run Spectrum programs distributed as Z80 files. Further, it
can only run 48k programs.

Don't forget that the classic Spectrum games we can play today on emulators remain the result of the skills and
dedication of the programmers who developed them. While many have granted free distribution rights for their games,
others have not, and it is their right to do so. As such, please be considerate when downloading emulator files,
and refer to the information [here](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits),
[here](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/publishers.html) and [here](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/individuals.html)
for full details on which publishers and developers have granted free distribution rights.
