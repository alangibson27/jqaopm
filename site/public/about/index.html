<p>Do you remember Match Day II?</p>

<p>Long before FIFA, Pro Evolution Soccer or any of the others, Match Day II managed to succinctly capture the essence of
football in just 48k. No fouls, free kicks, substitutions, sendings-off or penalties - just pass, tackle, volley, head
and save. You can easily imagine how a well-worked goal in Match Day II must look much like a football purist&rsquo;s idea of
perfection.</p>

<p>Of course, none of this was in the minds of me or my friends when we were growing up playing this Match Day II. All we
had was this compellingly playable game, and a conviction that we must be the best people in the world at playing it.
Time passes, people move on and circumstances change, but from time to time I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if my friends
and I were to play Match Day II against each other once more.</p>

<p>The only surprise is that it took me so long to come up with the idea of Plus-F as a way of answering that question.</p>
