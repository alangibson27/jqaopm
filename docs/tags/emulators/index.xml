      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fundamental thing an emulator does is, by definition, copy the behaviour of something else. And so it is
with +F, which emulates a real ZX Spectrum. The catch, sadly, is that I don&amp;rsquo;t have one of those to hand, so
without the real thing as a reference, how can I check that +F is working properly? The answer lies in the
fantastic emulators that others have written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mainly run Linux at home, and over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;FUSE Emulator&lt;/a&gt;.
From my time using it, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed confidence that it is a faithful emulation of a ZX Spectrum, and at
various points in the development of +F I&amp;rsquo;ve used it as my reference. When I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if my Z80 emulation
code was setting flags correctly, or I wanted to see what the behaviour of a particular block of assembly code
was, I would run identical tests against FUSE and +F, and where +F gave a different answer, I could be confident
that there was a bug in there which I needed to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, FUSE also comes with a handy set of debugging tools, which I also made use of at various times -
notably in checking I had the right behaviour for incrementing the value of the refresh register. (There was also
another time where I poured away days of effort trying to squash a bug I&amp;rsquo;d introduced unthinkingly as a
result of the fundamental misconception that the Spectrum ROM would never try to overwrite itself, but more
on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is simply to say that, without FUSE, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to develop +F. While +F does have
a few tweaks and twiddles that FUSE doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, it&amp;rsquo;s still inferior in many ways, and if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a
solid Spectrum emulator that&amp;rsquo;s packed full of features and gives you an authentic experience, try FUSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also goes without saying that I&amp;rsquo;m deeply thankful to FUSE&amp;rsquo;s author for his work, and also very much in awe
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
