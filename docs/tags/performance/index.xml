      <description>&lt;p&gt;The just-about-holding-together addition of tape loading emulation I told you about
&lt;a href=&#34;../if-you-only-do-one-thing&#34;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; was the last but one of the major bits

It started off with the working title QAOPM, and was written in Python.</description>
