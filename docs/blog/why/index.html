<h1>Why? (31-Oct-2016)</h1>

<p>There are plenty of perfectly adequate Spectrum emulators already freely available, so why did I feel the need to write
+F?</p>

<p>It did all start with the idea to make possible 2-player Spectrum gaming across a network - which, as far as I was
aware at the time I started out, wasn&rsquo;t possible in any other existing Spectrum emulator - but that wasn&rsquo;t my only
motivation.</p>

<p>Mainly, I wanted to learn, and to have a project of my own to sink my teeth into, experiment with, and give me a place
to have a go at applying things that I have read or thought about. Trust me, I learned a lot, and certainly a lot more
than I thought I might.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what this blog is about. I didn&rsquo;t set out to write a blog as a companion to +F or its site. A blog which simply
described a series of updates, bug fixes and new features on a project of no real significance would have been very
dull. Instead, I&rsquo;m writing all of these blog posts after the fact, with (I expect) well over 90% of the work on +F
already complete. I&rsquo;m able to put what I&rsquo;ve learned into context for you, and hopefully you&rsquo;ll find what I&rsquo;m presenting
to be helpful, informative and entertaining.</p>

<p>You may have noticed a theme emerging already - learning. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed about +F. In truth, I&rsquo;ve
barely actually used it for playing games. What have I learned? Obviously, an awful lot about the Z80&rsquo;s instruction
set, everything I hadn&rsquo;t realised I&rsquo;d forgotten about two&rsquo;s complement binary, and how the innards of a Spectrum
function, among other.</p>

<p>Beyond that, though, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by how it seems to me that the fundamental laws of software development
apply anywhere and everywhere. Among others, and in no particular order, it&rsquo;s reinforced the reasons it&rsquo;s important
to have a clear vision of what you want your project to do; why you should write tests first; why it&rsquo;s really helpful
to understand what&rsquo;s happening beneath language abstractions; why prototyping is useful up-front but optimisation
should be left to the end.</p>

<p>None of these are at all novel, and in many cases they are principles which have been common software knowledge for
decades. In that respect, in what I do, I consider myself simply to be standing on the shoulders of the giants who
have gone before.</p>
