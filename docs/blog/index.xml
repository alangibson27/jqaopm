      <title>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fundamental thing an emulator does is, by definition, copy the behaviour of something else. And so it is
with +F, which emulates a real ZX Spectrum. The catch, sadly, is that I don&amp;rsquo;t have one of those to hand, so
without the real thing as a reference, how can I check that +F is working properly? The answer lies in the
fantastic emulators that others have written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mainly run Linux at home, and over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;FUSE Emulator&lt;/a&gt;.
From my time using it, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed confidence that it is a faithful emulation of a ZX Spectrum, and at
various points in the development of +F I&amp;rsquo;ve used it as my reference. When I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if my Z80 emulation
code was setting flags correctly, or I wanted to see what the behaviour of a particular block of assembly code
was, I would run identical tests against FUSE and +F, and where +F gave a different answer, I could be confident
that there was a bug in there which I needed to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, FUSE also comes with a handy set of debugging tools, which I also made use of at various times -
notably in checking I had the right behaviour for incrementing the value of the refresh register. (There was also
another time where I poured away days of effort trying to squash a bug I&amp;rsquo;d introduced unthinkingly as a
result of the fundamental misconception that the Spectrum ROM would never try to overwrite itself, but more
on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is simply to say that, without FUSE, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to develop +F. While +F does have
a few tweaks and twiddles that FUSE doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, it&amp;rsquo;s still inferior in many ways, and if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a
solid Spectrum emulator that&amp;rsquo;s packed full of features and gives you an authentic experience, try FUSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also goes without saying that I&amp;rsquo;m deeply thankful to FUSE&amp;rsquo;s author for his work, and also very much in awe
of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why?</title>
      <link>http://plusf.socialthingy.com/blog/why/</link>

      <guid>http://plusf.socialthingy.com/blog/why/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why did I bother writing +F? There are already plenty of fully-featured, freely-available Spectrum emulators for
more or less any platform you care to think of. Indeed, I remember using a perfectly playable one on the Commodore
Amiga as far back as 1994 or 1995 (ZXAM by Antonio J. Pomar Rosell√≥), so it&amp;rsquo;s hardly a novel idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have a little twist which I wanted to add, which at the time I started writing didn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be available
in any other emulator, namely the ability to play games across the Internet. (It turns out that &lt;a href=&#34;http://zxm.speccy.cz/realspec/&#34;&gt;RealSpec&lt;/a&gt;
claims to do this and more, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than just that, though, it was probably inevitable I would end up trying this sooner or later. Much like
mountaineers are reputed to climb mountains &amp;ldquo;because they&amp;rsquo;re there&amp;rdquo;, or lovelorn teenage boys write dreadful and
embarrassing poetry, the chances of a programming geek with a fondness for 80s gaming writing an emulator are
rather high. (Given I&amp;rsquo;d already written a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speccy-loading-borders/jakeajfeddddpglibndhjhdmlinejihf&#34;&gt;Chrome plugin that uses CSS to emulate Spectrum loading borders&lt;/a&gt;,
it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve got form.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So Mr. Nerdy-Nerdy has a warm, fuzzy feeling about his pet project&lt;/em&gt;, you may be thinking. &lt;em&gt;Very good, move along.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to a certain extent, you&amp;rsquo;re right. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing novel about +F and I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning to blog about
it. Indeed, if I was just a programming geek by night, I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have, but I&amp;rsquo;ve actually also been a programming
geek by profession for the best part of two decades. When you do anything for that length of time, it becomes something
of an overlearned skill, something you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to devote much conscious thought to.
You learn all manner of techniques and best practices from the people you work with, you learn your own lessons, and
most of all you tend to adopt and fit in with the way that your team works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine that with time pressures and shifting requirements, and it can be easy to go through the motions and forget &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;
you do things the way you do them. Best practices which develop some form of longevity are likely to provide benefits,
but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to slip into something of a ritualistic mentality about the way you build software. &lt;em&gt;If we write the magic
number of unit tests, make sure the size in bytes of our zip file is an odd number and sacrifice a chicken, the Gods will
smile upon us and our release will be successful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With +F being a personal hobby project, and me being answerable to nobody but myself for its success or otherwise, I
wasn&amp;rsquo;t subject to the formalities of software development which I&amp;rsquo;ve become used to in my day job. I could completely
freely choose which ones to follow and which ones to ignore. It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that there was a fair amount of unwarranted
bravado about the choices I made, an air of &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m old enough to know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing&lt;/em&gt; about my approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is the catalogue of gaffes, goofs and prat-falls you&amp;rsquo;re going to read about in this blog. I will, of course,
make the odd diversion into the simultaneously mundane and fascinating details of emulation, but what I really want to
get across as I write is that there really &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; good reasons why we do things the way we do, and if we lose sight of that
then we are bound to repeat the mistakes of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That does sound rather heavy, but the flip-side is to realise that there are so many signposts guiding us down the path
to success, and it&amp;rsquo;s that note of encouragement I hope you take away with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you find my writing enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
